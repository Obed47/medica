Ensure the Token Is Validated The patient service uses rest_framework_simplejwt to automatically validate incoming JWTs. When a client includes a valid token in the Authorization header:

The JWTTokenUserAuthentication class will decode and verify the token using the shared signing key.
If the token is valid, the request will proceed. Otherwise, a 401 Unauthorized error will be returned.

Decoupling Services Without Direct Communication
The patient service doesn't need to communicate directly with the authentication service.
Instead, it only validates the token locally using the shared signing key.
By following this approach, your system remains resilient even if the authentication 
service is temporarily unavailable. Only new authentication requests (e.g., token generation or refresh) will depend on the availability of the authentication service.
